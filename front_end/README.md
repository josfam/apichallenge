> ðŸ“Œ Make sure [you have set up and run the backend first](../back_end/README.md#how-to-manually-install-and-run-the-backend)

## How to manually install and run the frontend

### 1. Navigate to the `front_end` folder, and install the dependencies

(this assumes that you have `node` installed)

```sh
cd front_end && npm install
```

### 2. Start the frontend server in a separate terminal

- On a linux computer

```sh
gnome-terminal -- bash -c "npm run dev"
```

- On a Mac

```sh
open -a Terminal "npm run dev"
```

\
\
**Output**: The new terminal that opens should have output similar to this

```sh
  VITE v5.4.6  ready in 194 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: http://192.168.100.7:5173/
  âžœ  press h + enter to show help

```

### 3. Open the url provided by the frontend server in your browser

Copy and paste the web url (http://localhost:5173/) in this example into the url
\
bar of your web browser.
\
\
You can now start using the app
